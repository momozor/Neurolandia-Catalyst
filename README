Neurolandia::Catalyst
---------------------
Neurolandia::Catalyst is a revamped version of Neurolandia Mojolicious that I made.
It is a blog with typical CRUD operations, authentication and authorization.
No registration is included due to the concept of the web app being similar to the
core Wordpress application.

Testing
-------
Neurolandia::Catalyst (NC) development sees automated testing as one of the
most important technique for the past and the coming future.

Run prove -wl t to run the test *after* you ran the migration script.

Local Server
------------
You can see how it works and looks in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:3000 by
running script/neurolandia_catalyst_server.pl.
