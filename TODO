* Make an exception class for CLI::Testing->is_test_path_correct and CLI->carton_execute
* Make migrate helper script to be able to accept db configs as cli parameters
instead of using global $ENV{}.
* Change author class into user class
    - author has a password and email address? doesn't make a damn sense.
    - a user model would be better, right?
* Finish authentication operations.
* Settle front-end design (uh,..urgh)
* include an 'overwrite' or 'override' option to migration helper script
